By continuing with this booking process, the Purchaser agrees to be bound by all terms and conditions laid out below.<br>
Successful booking of tickets (as signified by the confirmation Email) represents a firm offer, the acceptance of which is established by either a

be made entirely at their discretion. The Committee reserves the right to levy an administration charge of Â£5 per Ticket for completing a refund or transfer.<br>
In the event that the Ball has to be cancelled, the Purchaser assumes the risk that remuneration may not be available. Partial or full refunds will be given
